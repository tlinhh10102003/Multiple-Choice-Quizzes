# Multiple-Choice-Quizzes

## Project Description

This mini project is developed as part of an assignment of course COIS 3430: Web Development II: Server-side and Frameworks. The purpose of this mini project is to create a 5 question online multiple choice quiz about a subject of personal choice (and mine is about my favorite football club FC Barcelona - please don't laugh at me).

For this mini project, each question will appear on its own (self-processing) page. On submission of a question, the page will check the user's answer and store feedback (including the correct answer if they got it wrong) in a feedback array in SESSION.

The feedback for each question (correct answers should be stylistically different then incorrect ones) will be displayed on completion of the quiz including the user's score, and a summary feedback message based on their score.
